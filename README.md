# Assistant 365 Bridge

A tiny always-on backend that lets an AI assistant (like ChatGPT with tools) **promote tasks into Microsoft 365 / Outlook / To Do** with a simple command, e.g.:

> “Promote task 3 to 365.”

The backend exposes a small HTTPS API (on your Ubuntu server, via Cloudflare Tunnel) that:

1. Accepts a task payload from the assistant (`/promoteTask`)
2. Calls **Microsoft Graph** to create a task in **Microsoft To Do → “Tasks” list**
3. Returns a simple JSON confirmation

This repo is designed to be:
- **Minimal** (no DB required at first)
- **Free to run** (Ubuntu + Cloudflare Tunnel)
- **AI-friendly** (clean API for tools / agents)
- **Extendable** later (list tasks, sync status, etc.)

---

## High-Level Architecture

Components:

1. **Ubuntu Server (Your Box)**  
   - Runs a small Node.js (or Python/.NET) web server
   - Listens only on localhost or private network
   - Exposed to the internet via **Cloudflare Tunnel**

2. **Cloudflare Tunnel**  
   - Maps something like `https://assistant.yancmo.xyz` → your local server  
   - Provides valid HTTPS, no port-forwarding needed  

3. **Assistant 365 Bridge Backend** (this project)  
   - HTTP API with endpoints like:
     - `GET /health` – for monitoring
     - `POST /promoteTask` – create an Outlook/To Do task
   - Uses Microsoft Graph to talk to Microsoft 365

4. **Microsoft Graph (cloud)**  
   - Receives authenticated calls from your backend
   - Creates tasks in your Microsoft To Do “Tasks” list

5. **AI Assistant (ChatGPT with tools / future custom app)**  
   - Calls `/promoteTask` as a tool/action
   - You say “Promote task 3 to 365”
   - Assistant sends JSON to the backend
   - Backend creates the task in 365

## Personal Task Sync Bridge (Microsoft To Do → Apple Calendar)

This repo also includes an optional “task → calendar event” bridge designed to make **Personal** tasks show up reliably in Apple Calendar on macOS + iOS.

### How it works (recommended)

1. **Power Automate** triggers when a new Microsoft To Do task is created/updated.
2. The flow filters to **Category = Personal**.
3. The flow sends an HTTP POST to this service:
  - `POST /webhooks/powerAutomate/todo`
4. The service normalizes the payload, adds a trace tag, de-dupes retries, and forwards the event payload to an Apple-side automation runner (e.g., Pushcut) via `APPLE_EVENT_WEBHOOK_URL`.

### Endpoints

- `GET /webhooks/powerAutomate/todo/sample` (🔒 requires `X-Assistant-Key`) — returns a sample payload
- `POST /webhooks/powerAutomate/todo` (🔒 requires `X-Assistant-Key`) — inbound webhook from Power Automate

### Notes

- Apple Calendar events are identified by a trace tag added to notes:
  - `[msTodoTaskId:<id>]`
- If `APPLE_EVENT_WEBHOOK_URL` is not configured, the webhook endpoint will accept but will not forward (returns `202`).

---

## OpenAI / Chat Agent model configuration (future)

This backend is primarily a Microsoft Graph bridge today. If/when you add OpenAI-powered chat/automation modules, the active model name is centralized in:

- `src/config/aiModel.js`

Configure via environment variable:

- `OPENAI_MODEL` (preferred)
- `MODEL_VERSION` (legacy alias)

Default is `gpt-5.2` (updated **2025-12-22**).

---

## Phase 1 Goals (MVP)

1. **Run a web server on Ubuntu** (Node.js assumed for now)
2. **Expose it via Cloudflare Tunnel**
3. Implement:
   - `GET /health`  
   - `POST /promoteTask` (stubbed, logs payload for now)
4. Confirm:
   - You can hit `/health` from the internet
   - You can send test `POST /promoteTask` JSON and see it in logs

No 365 integration yet in Phase 1. Just plumbing.

---

## Phase 2 Goals (Microsoft 365 Integration)

1. Register an app in **Azure AD / Entra ID** for **delegated Microsoft Graph access**  
   - We want to act as *your user* to create **your** To Do tasks  
2. Implement an **OAuth flow** (authorization code or device code) to get:
   - Access token
  - Persistent MSAL token cache (stored securely on Ubuntu)
3. Use the token to:
   - Find the list ID of the “Tasks” list
   - Create tasks via Graph:
     - `POST /me/todo/lists/{list-id}/tasks`

Once Phase 2 is done, `/promoteTask` becomes “real” and actually writes to Outlook/To Do.

---

## API Design (for the Assistant)

This is the contract the AI / tool will call. Even in stub mode, keep this solid.

### `GET /health`

**Purpose:** Basic uptime check for monitoring and for tools to confirm connectivity.

- **Method:** `GET`
- **Path:** `/health`
- **Request body:** _none_
- **Response (200):**
  ```json
  {
    "status": "ok",
    "service": "assistant-365-bridge",
    "version": "0.1.0"
  }
  ```

---

### `POST /promoteTask`

**Purpose:** Create a new task in the user’s Microsoft To Do “Tasks” list.  
For now (Phase 1) this can just log the payload. In Phase 2, it will call Microsoft Graph.

- **Method:** `POST`
- **Path:** `/promoteTask`
- **Headers:**
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
  - (Optional) `X-Client` or some shared secret later for basic auth

- **Request Body (from assistant/tool):**
  ```json
  {
    "title": "Look into Campaign Monitor as a Constant Contact replacement",
    "notes": "Compare templates, poll options, pricing, and migration effort.",
    "importance": "high",        // "low" | "normal" | "high"
    "dueDate": "2025-01-15",     // Optional, ISO date string
    "source": "chatgpt-task-inbox",  // Optional metadata
    "externalId": "task-3"       // ID from the assistant's internal task list, optional
  }
  ```

- **Response (Phase 1 stub, 200):**
  ```json
  {
    "status": "stubbed",
    "message": "Task accepted but not yet sent to Microsoft 365.",
    "echo": { ... original payload ... }
  }
  ```

- **Response (Phase 2 real, 200):**
  ```json
  {
    "status": "created",
    "microsoftTaskId": "AAMkAGI2...",
    "listDisplayName": "Tasks",
    "title": "Look into Campaign Monitor as a Constant Contact replacement"
  }
  ```

If something fails (auth, Graph, etc.), return 4xx/5xx with a clear error.

## Suggested Tech Stack

We’ll pick one primary implementation language.  
**Proposal: Node.js + Express** (easy HTTP, good MS Graph support, you’re comfortable with JS via VS Code).

- Runtime: Node.js 20+  
- Web framework: `express`  
- HTTP client: `axios` or native `fetch` (Node 18+ has built-in `fetch`)  
- Auth: `@azure/msal-node` for delegated auth (Phase 2)  

Final choice of language can change; this spec is language-agnostic enough that Copilot can scaffold whatever we choose.

---

## Suggested File Structure

Once you are at your computer, Copilot can build something like:

```text
assistant-365-bridge/
  ├─ src/
  │   ├─ server.ts             # or server.js
  │   ├─ routes/
  │   │   ├─ health.ts
  │   │   └─ promoteTask.ts
  │   ├─ services/
  │   │   ├─ graphClient.ts    # wraps Graph calls (Phase 2)
  │   │   └─ taskService.ts    # business logic for promoting tasks
  │   └─ config/
  │       └─ env.ts
  ├─ package.json
  ├─ tsconfig.json             # if using TypeScript
  ├─ .env.example
  └─ README.md  (this file)
```

For now, all we care about is:

- `server.(js|ts)`  
- `health` route  
- `promoteTask` route (logs only)

## Phase 1 — TODO Checklist

You can copy this into a GitHub Issue later.

- [ ] Create GitHub repo: `assistant-365-bridge`
- [ ] Add this README as `README.md`
- [ ] On Ubuntu:
  - [ ] Install Node.js 20+ (`nvm` recommended)
  - [ ] Clone repo to Ubuntu
  - [ ] Run `npm init -y`
  - [ ] Install dependencies:
    - `express`
    - `dotenv`
- [ ] Implement `src/server.js` with:
  - [ ] `GET /health` returning static JSON
  - [ ] `POST /promoteTask` that:
    - [ ] Parses JSON body
    - [ ] Logs payload to console
    - [ ] Returns stubbed response JSON
- [ ] Test locally with `curl` or Postman
- [ ] Set up Cloudflare Tunnel:
  - [ ] Create a tunnel for local port (e.g., 3000)
  - [ ] Map hostname `assistant.yancmo.xyz` to that tunnel
- [ ] Test `GET https://assistant.yancmo.xyz/health` from your phone

Once all of the above works, we move to Phase 2.

## Phase 2 — Microsoft Graph Integration (Outline)

> **Note:** Do not try to fully wire this up from your phone.  
> We’ll do this carefully at your computer.

### 1. Register an App in Azure AD / Entra ID

- Go to Azure Portal → App registrations
- Create a new app, e.g. **Assistant365Bridge**
- Type: “Web app” or “Public client / native” depending on chosen flow
- Configure redirect URI (for OAuth callback) if using auth code flow

We want **delegated permissions**, not just app-only, so the app can access **your** To Do tasks.

**Permissions to request** (delegated):

- `Tasks.ReadWrite`  
- Possibly: `offline_access` (for refresh tokens)  
- Possibly: `User.Read` (basic profile)

### 2. Choose an Auth Flow

We have two realistic options:

#### Option A: Authorization Code Flow (More “Web App” style)
- You visit a login URL once (hosted by your backend)
- Sign in with your Microsoft 365 account
- Backend receives an authorization code → exchanges it for tokens
- Backend stores:
  - Access token (short-lived)
  - MSAL token cache (includes refresh tokens) in a secure file/store on Ubuntu

**Pros:** Standard, works well, good for one user (you)  
**Cons:** Slightly more setup (callback endpoint)

#### Option B: Device Code Flow (More “CLI” style)
- From Ubuntu or your machine, you run a script:
  - It prints a code and a URL (e.g., `https://microsoft.com/devicelogin`)
  - You go there on any device, enter the code, log in
- Script gets tokens and stores them on disk

**Pros:** Easier to do as a one-time setup  
**Cons:** Slightly less “web app” like, but perfectly fine for personal use

Either way, once we have an MSAL cache (including refresh tokens), the backend can silently refresh tokens and call Microsoft Graph whenever `/promoteTask` is hit.

### 3. Implement Graph Helper

Pseudocode sketch (not final code):

```ts
// src/services/graphClient.ts

// Implemented: MSAL token management via persistent disk cache
// See: src/services/persistentAuth.js

export async function createTodoTask(input: {
  title: string;
  notes?: string;
  importance?: "low" | "normal" | "high";
  dueDate?: string; // ISO date
}) {
  const accessToken = await getAccessTokenForUser(); // via MSAL + persistent disk cache

  // 1. Get list ID for "Tasks" list (once; cache in memory)
  const listId = await getTasksListId(accessToken);

  // 2. Build request body
  const body = {
    title: input.title,
    importance: input.importance ?? "normal",
    body: input.notes
      ? {
          content: input.notes,
          contentType: "text"
        }
      : undefined,
    dueDateTime: input.dueDate
      ? {
          dateTime: input.dueDate + "T17:00:00",
          timeZone: "America/Chicago" // adjust as needed
        }
      : undefined
  };

  // 3. POST to Graph
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/todo/lists/${listId}/tasks`,
    {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Authorization": `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(body)
    }
  );

  if (!response.ok) {
    const text = await response.text();
    throw new Error(`Graph error: ${response.status} ${text}`);
  }

  return await response.json();
}
```

The actual implementation will depend on how we set up MSAL, but this shows the shape.

## Assistant Interaction Examples (Future)

Once this is running and connected to ChatGPT tools, your natural language flow will be:

> **You:**  
> “Add to my task inbox: Look into Campaign Monitor as a Constant Contact replacement.”

> **You (later):**  
> “Promote task 1 to 365 and set due date for next Friday.”

> **Assistant:**  
> - Resolves “task 1” to:
>   - Title + notes + importance + due date  
> - Calls `/promoteTask` with that JSON  
> - Backend calls Microsoft Graph  
> - Task appears in your To Do “Tasks” list  
> - Assistant replies:
>   ```json
>   {
>     "status": "created",
>     "microsoftTaskId": "...",
>     "title": "Look into Campaign Monitor as a Constant Contact replacement"
>   }
>   ```

You never copy/paste anything. Your Ubuntu box + Cloudflare + this bridge do all the heavy lifting.
